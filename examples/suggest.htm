		CFAjax suggest works on the same principal as the google suggest do. i.e. as you type the search terms/characters 
		in the search box, real time filtered results are shown. You can then use arrow keys or your mouse to select any of 
		the suggestions. But, you can instead continue to key the remaining words in the search box to further refine the suggestions
